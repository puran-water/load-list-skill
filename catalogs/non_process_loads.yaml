  rule_of_thumb:
    heat_dissipation_pct: 2.5
    notes: |
      Assume 2-3% of electrical equipment kW rating dissipates as heat.
      HVAC must remove this heat plus building envelope load.

      Emergency generator sizing is project-specific.
      Typically 25-50% of normal demand load for essential services.
      Full backup of all process loads rarely economical.

# USAGE NOTES
# ============================================================================

usage_notes: |
  These allowances are for PRELIMINARY sizing only.

  For detailed design:
  1. Develop actual lighting layout and calculate connected load
  2. Size HVAC based on heat balance (equipment heat + envelope)
  3. Enumerate instrumentation and control power loads
  4. Include fire pump if required (check with authority)

  Disclaimer:
  Actual non-process loads vary significantly by:
  - Climate zone
  - Building construction
  - Level of automation
  - Security requirements
  - Regulatory requirements (fire pump, etc.)

  Always verify assumptions with project-specific information.
